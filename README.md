# Socket-Server
* Creation of a server using Python’s socketserver module that counts the number of words and characters in a string sent by a client. The server will also perform specific operations based on the first character of the string which are:
  1. If the first character is ‘W’, the server will return the number of words in the string.
  2. If the first character is ‘L’, the server will return the number of lowercase letters in the string.
  3. If the first character is ‘U’, the server will return the number of uppercase letters in the string.
  4. If the first character is ‘R’, the server will return the number of numeric characters in the string.
  5. If the first character is ‘T’, the server will return the total number of characters in the string.
  6. If the first character is none of the above, the server will return the same message it receives.
* Run the client sise from 'clientScript.py' file and run the server side from 'serverScript.py'.
